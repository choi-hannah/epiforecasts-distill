      "description": "We are a team based at the \n[London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk) who \nfocus on real-time modelling and forecasting of infectious disease outbreaks. \nWe are funded by the Wellcome Trust and work in collaboration with a number of\nother research groups, public health agencies and non-governmental\norganisations. Our main aim is to develop and use modelling methodology that\nmakes the most of available resources to provide insights useful for outbreak\nresponse, control and prevention. ",

This includes developing and evaluating methods for short-term forecasting, testing the predictive value of additional data sources on pathogen biology and human behaviour, and doing all of this in order to inform public health decision making. He strongly believes that science should done openly and that there is great value in developing methods as tools that can be used by others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAkira Endo      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAkira is a JSPS research fellow who completed his PhD at LSHTM on dynamics of influenza and COVID-19. His research interests include disease spread within and across households/schools/workplaces, improving vaccine evaluation methodologies and optimal control strategies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHannah Choi  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNam ut est ad modi illo aperiam.

Inventore voluptate enim quam vel. Voluptatem est veniam eius sunt porro error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJames Munday      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJames’ research focuses on the impact of geographic and social structure on infectious disease transmission. He is currently working on methods to include spatial interaction and age-structured-mixing in epidemic forecasting and real-time analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKatharine Sherratt      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’m a research assistant at LSHTM and spend most of my time working on the European Covid-19 Forecast Hub. My background is in epidemiology and I have a strong interest in collaborative and interdisciplinary approaches to public health.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNikos Bosse      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNikos is a PhD student working on infectious disease forecasting and is interested in all things related to forecasting. As part of his work he developed crowdforecastr to compare human forecasts of COVID-19 against model-based predictions. He also has a strong interest in forecast evaluation and proper scoring rules and developed the scoringutils package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSam Abbott      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSam’s main interests are developing, evaluating, and applying methods for improving our understanding of infectious disease dynamics in real-time. See his personal website for more detail on his current research and interests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSophie Meakin      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSophie’s research interests are in the application of mathematical modelling to support preparedness and decision-making during infectious disease outbreaks. Before joining CMMID, Sophie worked for the World Health Organisation as part of the 2018-2020 North-Kivu Ebola outbreak response. Sophie received her PhD in applied mathematics from the University of Warwick in 2020.\n\n\n\n\nFormer team members\n\nAlexis Robert · Flavio Finger · Joel Hellewell · Joseph Palmer · Robin Thompson\n\n\n\n\n",
